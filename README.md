# Pipe Connection Game
## 1. Game explanation
Welcome to Pipe Connection, a captivating puzzle game where players manipulate pipe blocks using a PS2 keyboard to irrigate a thirsty plant displayed on a VGA screen.

The objective of Pipe Connection is simple: players must strategically connect all randomized pipe blocks to connect them from the starting point to the endpoint.

The game features two levels of increasing difficulty. In the first level, a single predetermined solution is hardcoded in the program and randomized before being presented on the VGA screen. Players should navigate the pipes to achieve the correct connection and success.

Level two presents a greater challenge. In addition to randomizing the blocks according to one of the hardcoded solutions, the game introduces randomly placed pipe blocks of various shapes around the standard solution. This creates multiple possible solutions, testing players' problem-solving skills even further. To ensure connectivity from start to finish, we implemented a robust algorithm treating each pipe as a block with four connectable or un-connectable edges.

To enhance the gaming experience, audio elements are added to immerse players further into the game.

Use the PS2 keyboard to maneuver the pipes and conquer each level. Are you ready to take on the challenge and help the plant thrive?
